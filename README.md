# seafile-browse [![Build](https://github.com/thatoddmailbox/seafile-browse/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/thatoddmailbox/seafile-browse/actions/workflows/build.yml)

A command-line client to browse a [Seafile](https://seafile.com) data repository. Uses [fsbrowse](https://github.com/thatoddmailbox/fsbrowse) to provide a web UI to look through the files. Also provides an [fs.FS](https://pkg.go.dev/io/fs#FS)-implementing client in the `seafile` module, which could hypothetically be used directly by something else.
