# seafile-browse [![Build](https://github.com/thatoddmailbox/seafile-browse/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/thatoddmailbox/seafile-browse/actions/workflows/build.yml)

A command-line client to browse a Seafile data repository. Uses [fsbrowse](https://github.com/thatoddmailbox/fsbrowse) to provide a web UI to look through the files. Also provides an fs.FS-implementing client in the `seafile` module, which could hypothetically be used directly by something else.
